# Scene-creation-with-IPGcarmaker

Simulation is one of the crucial parts of the autonomous vehicle stack. It has importance in pre-training, at the time of inference, and post-analysis based on the algorithm and application. Today a lot of Autonomous related simulators are in the industry. One of those is IPGCarmaker. 

I used this simulator as a part of the SAEindia competition. As part of this competition, the initial round is to create challenging scenarios to be solved in further stages by selecting the proper sensor suite and algorithm. I worked on abnormal weather conditions like a dense fog scenario where even human drivers face it as a challenge. I recreated this scenario in the IPGCarmaker3 simulator.
